# gridSearch

Run by simply opening the html file in any web browser. Double-clicking on the file should do it.

There will be several input fields on the website and you can change but the default values match the assignment example.

The first button to click is "Initialize grid" This will render a grid of your specific input values

there are then three buttons that will run the respective algorithm.

Clicking initialize grid again also clears the path that may have been drawn by another algorithm

Going into the console of the website would allow you to see all final paths in coordinates and information on how the path is being drawn on the grid.

The solution of the depth for the IDDFS will be shown on the screen after clicking on the button

All code for the three algorithms can be found at the bottom of the html file in the <Script> section. All written in JS
